# Refactor Backlog

## Scope

- Criteria: quality attributes (performance, scalability, reliability, availability, safety, security, resilience, correctness, usability, portability)
- Objective: strengthen operational stability and data correctness first, then extend to performance and security hardening

## Priority Roadmap

| Priority | Theme | Tasks | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| P1 | Operational baseline and correctness | readiness (DB/Redis), segments idempotency, mojibake cleanup | Completed |
| P2 | Operations hardening | Redis rate limiter hardening, metrics cardinality protection, version policy automation | Completed |
| P3 | Security and operations hardening | JWT/RBAC, trusted proxy chain validation, SBOM/vulnerability scan | In Progress |
| P4 | SLO and observability ops | SLI/SLO, error budget policy, alert policy | Pending |

## P1 Backlog (Current Scope)

### 1) Readiness Probe Split

- [x] Add `GET /health/live` (liveness)
- [x] Add `GET /health/ready` (DB/Redis readiness)
- [x] Return `503` with per-check details on readiness failure
- [x] Update API documentation

### 2) Segments Idempotency

- [x] Add dedupe key (`dedupe_hash`) to `council_speech_segments`
- [x] Apply `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on insert
- [x] Generate deterministic hash from normalized payload in service layer
- [x] Add migration and tests

### 3) Mojibake Cleanup

- [x] Fix encoding-corrupted user-facing error messages and meeting number text
- [x] Confirm with full required test suite

## Definition of Done (P1)

- Unit/contract tests pass
- Documentation-route contract check passes
- Schema policy check passes
- Version consistency check passes
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` updated

## P2 Backlog (Current Scope)

### 1) Redis Rate Limiter Hardening

- [x] Add Redis failure cooldown to avoid per-request Redis retry storms
- [x] Add configurable fallback mode (`RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_OPEN`)
- [x] Keep readiness behavior explicit for Redis backend health
- [x] Add regression tests for fail-open/fail-closed cooldown behavior

### 2) Metrics Cardinality Protection Deepening

- [x] Normalize unknown HTTP methods to a bounded label (`OTHER`)
- [x] Keep path labels bounded (`/_unmatched`, max-length guard)
- [x] Normalize invalid status labels to bounded fallback (`000`)
- [x] Add regression test for method-label cardinality guard

### 3) Version Single-Source Verification Hardening

- [x] Extend `check_version_consistency.py` with changelog structure checks
- [x] Add `EXPECTED_VERSION` support for release-tag validation
- [x] Enforce release workflow to run version consistency script
- [ ] Add dedicated script unit tests (deferred to P3 quality pass)

## Definition of Done (P2)

- Unit/contract tests pass
- Docs-route contract check passes
- Schema policy check passes
- Version consistency check passes
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` updated

## P3 Backlog (Current Scope)

### 1) Trusted Proxy Chain Validation

- [x] Add trusted proxy CIDR configuration (`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`)
- [x] Use `X-Forwarded-For` only when remote peer is in trusted CIDR
- [x] Add regression tests for trusted/untrusted proxy behavior

### 2) JWT + RBAC

- [x] Add optional JWT authentication (`REQUIRE_JWT`, `JWT_SECRET`, HS256 validation)
- [x] Add claim validation (`exp`, optional `aud`, optional `iss`)
- [x] Add method-scope authorization (`JWT_SCOPE_READ/WRITE/DELETE`)
- [x] Add admin role bypass (`JWT_ADMIN_ROLE`)
- [x] Add regression tests for unauthorized/forbidden/authorized flows

### 3) Safety Guardrails (Ops Defaults)

- [x] Add startup validation for JWT config and algorithm support
- [x] Extend common error contracts with `403 FORBIDDEN`
- [ ] Add production profile presets for strict defaults (deferred to next P3 patch)

### 4) Supply Chain Baseline

- [ ] Add SBOM generation/check workflow
- [ ] Add vulnerability scanning workflow

## Definition of Done (P3-Current)

- Unit/contract tests pass
- Docs-route contract check passes
- Schema policy check passes
- Version consistency check passes
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` updated
